# Prime Words

A prime number is defined if it has exactly two divisors: the number one and itself. Examples are 2, 3, 5, 101, 367, 523.

In this problem, you must read a word composed by only chars `[a-z][A-Z]`. Each char has a specific value: `a = 1`, `b = 2` until `z = 26`. Either way, `A = 27`, `B = 28` until `Z = 52`.

You need to define if each word in a word set is prime or not. For it to be, the sum of the chars' value should be a primer number.
