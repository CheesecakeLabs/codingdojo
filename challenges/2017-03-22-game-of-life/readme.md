# Game of Life

Develop an algorithm that takes "one step" in the game of life. The behaviour examples may simply be the rules of the game:

 - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
 - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
 - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
 - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

You also have to think of things such as how to represent the board in a test-friendly way, and what "value" cells outside the board has. Or maybe the board does not have borders?
