# Bank Entries

Every time someone entry on the largest bank in the city of Pirenopolis, a log file is written
with the date and time the door was opened. Each record in the log file has the following format:


```
[YYYY-mm-dd H:i:s] - Door open OK
```

The bank manager needs to know how many people came in bank during the office hours,
so he asked we to make a program that checks if the entries are valid and within bank's operating
range. We should consider the bank's operating range between 10:00:00 until 16:00:00.
