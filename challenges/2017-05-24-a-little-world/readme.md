# A Little World

As a popular developer, you know a lot of people in your country. As you travel a lot, you decided that it would be useful to have a program that would say which of your friends are closer based on which friend you are actually visiting.

Each one of your friends live in a specific position (lat, lon) - to this problem the world is plane, the lat and lon are cartesian coordinates in a plane - and you can identify them somehow. Also, each friend lives in a different position (two friends are never in the same position).

Write a program that receives the location of all your friends and, for each one of them, tell who are the three closest.
