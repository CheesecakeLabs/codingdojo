# ATM Problem

Develop a program that simulates note delivery when a customer cashes an ATM. The basic requirements are as follows:

  - Deliver the least number of notes
  - It is possible to extract the requested value with the available notes
  - Infinite customer balance
  - Quantity of infinity notes (one can put a finite amount of notes to increase the difficulty of the problem)
  - Available notes of R$100.00; R$50.00; R$20.00 and R$10.00
