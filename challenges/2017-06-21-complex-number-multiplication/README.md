# Complex Number Multiplication

A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form `a + bi`, where `a` and `b` are real numbers and `i` is the imaginary unit, satisfying the equation `i2 = âˆ’1`. In this expression, `a` is the real part and `b` is the imaginary part of the complex number.

In this challenge, we have to develop a program that receives 2 Complex Numbers as a String, multiply them and return the result as a String.
