# Tic-tac-toe

Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

*Example:*
```
 x |__|__
 x |__|__
 x |  |

_x_|___|__
___|_x_|__
   |   | x
```
