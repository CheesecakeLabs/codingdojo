# Distribution of urinals

One problem faced by men in the use of urinals in public toilets is the embarrassment caused by another man urinating in the next urinal. A counter-situation is defined when two "users" should occupy adjacent urinals.

Given a number of urinals in a tailet and the initial occupation of them (telling them which one already has a "user"), determine how many "users" can still use urinals and what position they have before so there will not be an embarrassing situation.
