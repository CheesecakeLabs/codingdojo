# Cheesecake Labs Coding Dojo

![CodingDojo](/codingdojo.png)

Hi,   
this is the repository where we will keep our results from Coding Dojo sessions and all challenges that we want to do!

But, what is a Coding Dojo?

> A Coding Dojo is a meeting where a bunch of coders get together to work on a programming challenge. They are there have fun and to engage in deliberate practice in order to improve their skills.

To get more information, here is some links:

- [What is coding dojo?](http://codingdojo.org/)
- [The coding dojo](http://code.joejag.com/2009/the-coding-dojo.html)

## Modes
The Dojo can be made in three different modes:

### Kata
A presenter shows how to solve a problem. All participants should be able to reproduce the solution on their own, interrupting to make question or commentaries at any time.

### Randori
Everyone helps to solve a problem using one machine - in pairs - the pilot (who is coding) and the co-pilot (who is assisting). Each time frame (between 5 or 10 minutes), the co-pilot assumes the keyboard and someone from the audiance takes its place. The problem may has tests already produced, to create a definition of done. Also, the pair decides what to do to solve the problem, which should be explained as it goes.

### Kake
Likely the Randori, but multiple pairs working at the same time. On each turn, the pairs are changed, promoting more integration among all participants.

## Structure
Each challenge will be placed inside the `challenges` directory, with a descriptive name and the problem to be solved.

Once finished, the code created will be uploaded inside the challenge's directory.

## Contributing
Do you have a cool challenge or puzzle to be used in a Dojo session? Just create a pull request with a new folder inside `challenges` with its name and description.  
Also, here's a list of links with cool puzzles (if you know others, PR them too!):
